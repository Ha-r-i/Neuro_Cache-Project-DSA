# üß† NeuroCache ‚Äì Intelligent Cache System

NeuroCache is a modern, adaptive caching system that uses learning-based logic to optimize data retention and eviction. Unlike traditional caches like **LRU (Least Recently Used)** or **LFU (Least Frequently Used)** that follow static rules, NeuroCache dynamically learns and scores cached items based on their usage frequency and recency.

This intelligent behavior helps improve cache hit rates in scenarios like:
- Web browsers
- CPU/GPU memory caches
- CDN edge caching
- Recommendation systems
- Operating system page replacement

## üöÄ Features

‚úÖ Learns from usage patterns  
‚úÖ Eviction based on frequency and last-used time  
‚úÖ Lightweight and modular  
‚úÖ Clear output to visualize evictions and score changes  
‚úÖ Supports customization of scoring logic

## üß† How NeuroCache Works

NeuroCache assigns a **score** to each cache item:

score = frequency / (currentTime - lastUsedTime + 1)


- üìà High frequency ‚Üí more important  
- ‚è±Ô∏è Recently used ‚Üí higher priority  
- üßÆ Lower-scoring items get evicted when cache is full

This balances both **recency and frequency**, similar to a hybrid between LRU and LFU, with tunable logic for smarter decisions.

## üßæ Example Usage

```cpp
NeuroCache cache(3);  // Set capacity to 3

cache.put(1, 100);    // Add key 1
cache.put(2, 200);    // Add key 2
cache.put(3, 300);    // Add key 3

cache.get(1);         // Access key 1 (boosts frequency)
cache.put(4, 400);    // Cache full ‚Üí evict based on lowest score
cache.get(2);         // Key 2 might be evicted, will return -1 if so
```
