# Neuro_Cache-Project-DSA
NeuroCache is an intelligent cache that uses learning-based algorithms (like heuristics or RL) to predict and evict less useful items. Unlike static methods like LRU/LFU, it adapts to usage patterns, reducing latency, cache misses, and bandwidth in dynamic systems like browsers or CDNs.
